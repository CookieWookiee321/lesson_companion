# Lesson Companion

Lesson Companion is a work-in-progress made by myself, Michael Cullen. 

Lesson Companion was built with language instructors specifically in mind. This resulted in two primary goals, to record and retrieve information about past lessons and students, and to quickly and efficiently print PDF reports based on the lessons for students if needbe.
